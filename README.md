Platzi course
>This course helped me to learn more than the basics of git & github.

In this course I've learned:
 * All Git commands
 * The work flow in Github
 * True love towards good practices
 * Crazy tricks from the teacher
 * Teacher's multiples personalities

And as a happy reminder, **this README.md is a joke**. Designed as an example. If you make it here, DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, instead of that, go [watch the course](https://platzi.com/clases/git-github/)
